<!-- 1. em Unit
em is relative to the font size of the parent element.
If the parent font size is 16px, then 1em equals 16px. This scales with the parent, making it great for nested, proportional sizing.

2. rem Unit
rem is relative to the font size of the root element (usually <html>).
This makes rem units consistent across the document, unaffected by the nesting of elements.

3. vh (Viewport Height)
vh is based on the viewport height. 1vh equals 1% of the viewport height.
Useful for setting elements’ height in relation to the screen’s height.

4. vw (Viewport Width)
vw is based on the viewport width. 1vw equals 1% of the viewport width.
Often used for full-width sections or fluid font sizes. -->
