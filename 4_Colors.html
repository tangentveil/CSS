<!-- There are three different methods for defining colors in CSS: by name, RGB values, and hexadecimal values.

1. Color by Name:
CSS provides predefined color names that you can use directly in your styles. There are over 140 standard color names, like blue, green, red, and blueviolet, among others.

#para-1 {
    color: blueviolet;
}

2. Color by RGB:
The rgb() function allows you to define a color using its red, green, and blue (RGB) components. Each value ranges from 0 to 255.

#para-2 {
    color: rgb(223, 130, 54);
}

3. Color by Hex Value:
Hexadecimal colors are another way to define colors in CSS, and they are commonly used in web design. A hex color starts with #, followed by six characters representing the red, green, and blue values in hexadecimal format (ranging from 00 to FF).

#para-3 {
    color: white;
    background-color: #ff4532;
}

Here, the text color is set to white, and the background color is defined by the hex code #ff4532, which is a shade of red.

Additional Concept: Background Color
You can also set the background color of an element using the background-color property, which works similarly to the color property.

#para-2 { 
    background-color: rgb(0,0,0);
}
