<!-- 
With the help of CSS, you can put your HTML elements at the position of your choice. 

1. Position: static
This is the default position for any HTML element.
The element is placed in the normal document flow.

2. Position: relative
The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
You can adjust its position using top, right, bottom, or left properties, but the space originally allocated for the element remains unchanged.

Example:

#box3 {
    position: relative;
    top: 34px;
    left: 34px;
}
Here, box3 is moved 34px down and to the right from its original position, but the original space is still occupied.

3. Position: absolute
The element is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor that has a position other than static). If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the HTML element).

Example:

#box3 {
    position: absolute;
    top: 34px;
    left: 34px;
}
Here, box3 is moved 34px down and to the right relative to its nearest ancestor or the page.

4. Position: fixed
The element is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to the viewport. It remains fixed even when the page is scrolled.

Example:

#box3 {
    position: fixed;
    right: 4px;
    bottom: 2px;
}
box3 is stuck in the bottom-right corner of the viewport and will stay there even if you scroll.

5. Position: sticky
The element toggles between relative and fixed positioning depending on the user's scroll position.
It remains relative until the user scrolls past a certain point, after which it becomes fixed.
Example:

#box3 {
    position: sticky;
    top: 3px;
}
box3 will act as a normal block until the user scrolls past it, at which point it will stick to the top of the page. -->
