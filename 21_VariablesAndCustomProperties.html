<!-- CSS Variables and Custom Properties
CSS variables, also known as custom properties, allow you to define reusable values throughout your stylesheets. They differ from variables in traditional programming languages, as they can be scoped to specific elements or the entire document.

Key Features of CSS Variables:
Defined with the -- prefix: All custom properties must begin with two hyphens.
Scoped to their context: Custom properties can be defined at different levels (e.g., within a class or globally).
Accessed with the var() function: To use the variable, you call it using var(--variable-name). -->
